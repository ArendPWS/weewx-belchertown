0.3 August 22, 2018
* Fixed a bug with the DarkSky URL.
* Removed an extra pre-requisites check.  
* Updated the visibility unit check. DarkSky API does not return this in their output, so using a mixture of skin and weewx config settings, hopefully we can determine the unit you want. 
* Fixed another static unit on the records page.

0.2 August 22, 2018
* Added units to the darksky api url with "auto" units as the default. Auto units automatically selects units based on your geographic location.
* Added a windy icon by remixing a couple images together.
* Updated records page units which had some hard coded units by mistake
* Fixed lowest windchill on the records page
* Fixed a formatting error with the sunrise and sunset auto-refesh
