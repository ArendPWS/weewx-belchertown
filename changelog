* Skip NULL rain values in highcharts generator.
* Updated rainRate value on the front page and records page. 
* Fix all time record for barometer. It was showing dewpoint. Oops!
* Fixed a highcharts UTC graph error. Should prefer timezone offset now.
* Updated highcharts rain rounding to 2 decimals.
* Updated highcharts wind direction to have a hover and display the wind direction.
* Consolidated the getSocialShare and getNOAAdata into getAllTime, and renamed getAllTime to getData. Larger plan is to consolidate as much as possible to be able to minimize the number of SLE loops. This may or may not have a better performance, but I'll try and consolidate where it makes sense in an attempt at better performance.
* Added a version printout in syslog for easier troubleshooting.
* Removed about.inc and reports.inc from the installer because the installer was overwriting them. Please read the Readme on how to create these files.

* Fixed NOAA report conflict.
* Updated highcharts to reflect the station's UTC timezone offset.
* Front page MQTT live updates now optimized for metric and metricwx units.
* Now uses UTC offset for moment.js and "Data Received" timestamp when using MQTT.
* Fixed full moon icon.


0.4 August 23, 2018
* Better usage of getting the right label from the skin dict. This fixes the wrong windSpeed label in the DarkSky forecast row. Thanks Gary!
* Changes the way of determining the DarkSky visibility unit label values. Gets the unit from the API output, then sets the label. Fixes the wrong label when using "auto" for DarkSky units.
* Fixed a barometer rounding bug in the highcharts generator.


0.3 August 22, 2018
* Fixed a bug with the DarkSky URL.
* Removed an extra pre-requisites check.  
* Updated the visibility unit check. DarkSky API does not return this in their output, so using a mixture of skin and weewx config settings, hopefully we can determine the unit you want. 
* Fixed another static unit on the records page.


0.2 August 22, 2018
* Added units to the darksky api url with "auto" units as the default. Auto units automatically selects units based on your geographic location.
* Added a windy icon by remixing a couple images together.
* Updated records page units which had some hard coded units by mistake
* Fixed lowest windchill on the records page
* Fixed a formatting error with the sunrise and sunset auto-refesh


0.1 August 21, 2018
* Initial implementation
